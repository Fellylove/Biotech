# Risk Prediction of Diabetes at an Early Stage using Machine Learning Approach
 
Diabetes is the fastest growing chronic life-threatening diseases that affect more than 422 million people worldwide. Diabetes type 2 is caused mainly by environmental factors and lifestyle choices. Diabetes is a slow-developing disease and starts developing metabolic indicators well before they ever develop the disease. The diabetes is a disease which an individuals blood sugar is too high.
